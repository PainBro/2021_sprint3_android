# Overview

  This app is a sort of proof of concept for a system for a clicker game. The purpose for creating this was to mess around with a "per second" system. If in the app you click the "Buy Auto Clicker" button and have at least 10 clicks, it will add an auto clicker which will add .1 clicks per second. This doesn't show up until it reaches a higher whole number.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
